# The Manbarra people and Palm Island: From colonial resistance to contemporary cultural resurgence

The story of the Manbarra people and Palm Island represents one of Australia's most compelling narratives of Indigenous resistance, cultural survival, and contemporary resurgence. From their original sovereignty over the Palm Island group to their current efforts in land management and cultural preservation, the Manbarra journey illuminates both the devastating impacts of colonization and the remarkable resilience of Aboriginal culture.

## Traditional ownership meets forced multiculturalism

The Manbarra people, also known as Wulgurukaba, are the original Traditional Owners of Great Palm Island and surrounding islands. According to their Dreamtime stories, the Palm Island group was formed from fragments of the Rainbow Serpent, establishing a sacred connection to country that predates European arrival by tens of thousands of years. When Captain Cook sailed past in 1770, approximately 200 Manbarra people lived on the islands, maintaining their traditional way of life.

Everything changed in 1918 when the Queensland government established Palm Island as a penal settlement and mission, forcibly relocating Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples from over 40 different language groups across Queensland. This created an unprecedented situation where traditional Manbarra territory became home to what would become known as the Bwgcolman people - a term meaning "many tribes, one people" coined by Manbarra elder Dick Palm Island to unite these disparate communities under a collective identity.

## The mission era: Resistance under oppression

The mission era (1918-1970s) was marked by harsh government control and remarkable acts of resistance. Under superintendents like Robert Henry Curry and Roy Bartlam, residents endured brutal disciplinary methods including flogging, exile to Eclipse Island on bread and water rations, and forced labor for no wages. The 1930 Palm Island Tragedy saw Superintendent Curry kill his own children and shoot staff before being fatally shot himself, highlighting the explosive tensions of colonial control.

The most significant resistance came in 1957 when seven men - Albert "Albie" Geia, Willie Thaiday, Eric Lymburner, Sonny Sibley, Bill Congoo, George Watson, and Gordon Tapau - led a five-day strike demanding fair wages instead of rations. These "Magnificent Seven" were arrested at gunpoint, shackled, and forcibly deported with their families to different settlements across Queensland. **Their courage sparked a movement that would eventually lead to wage justice for Indigenous workers across Australia**.

Later resistance leaders included Fred and Iris Clay, who advocated for federal funding and self-governance in the 1970s before being deported by the Bjelke-Petersen government, and Lex Wotton, who led the 2004 Palm Island uprising following the death in custody of Mulrunji Doomadgee. Wotton's subsequent Federal Court victory against Queensland Police for racial discrimination marked another landmark in the ongoing struggle for justice.

## Contemporary Traditional Owners and community leaders

Today's Palm Island leadership structure reflects both traditional Manbarra authority and the multicultural Bwgcolman reality. **Mayor Alf Lacey leads the Palm Island Aboriginal Shire Council alongside Deputy Mayor Mersane Oui and councillors including Telstan Sibley, Germaine Bulsey, and Ebanese Oui** - representing a new generation of Indigenous leaders navigating complex governance challenges.

The current leadership operates through multiple interconnected organizations. The Wulgurukaba Yunbenun Aboriginal Corporation, registered in 2012, manages native title lands on Magnetic Island and maintains Manbarra cultural heritage. Meanwhile, organizations like the Palm Island Community Company, under CEO Rachel Atkinson and Chair Luella Bligh, deliver essential community services after achieving full community control in 2021.

Cultural preservation efforts center around the Bwgcolman Indigenous Knowledge Centre, where **Regina James has served as coordinator since 2010**, maintaining family history records and curating exhibitions that tell Palm Island's complex story. The Knowledge Centre functions as both a community library and a crucial repository of cultural memory for the dozens of tribal groups represented on the island.

## The Mingga Mingga Rangers: Traditional knowledge meets modern conservation

One of the most successful contemporary initiatives is the Mingga Mingga Land and Sea Rangers program, which exemplifies how traditional ecological knowledge can enhance modern conservation efforts. Operating under the governance of the Manbarra Elders Council and administered through Girringun Aboriginal Corporation, the program manages the Palm Island group within the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area.

**Richard Cassady, a Manbarra Traditional Owner, serves as the Mingga Mingga Ranger Coordinator**, leading partnerships with prestigious research institutions like the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS). The rangers conduct seagrass and coral monitoring, manage fire regimes using traditional burning practices, control invasive species, and protect cultural heritage sites across 16 islands.

The program emerged from the broader Indigenous Rangers movement launched in 2007, with funding from both federal and state governments. Recent expansions include $355 million in federal funding over four years (2024-2028) to double Indigenous ranger numbers nationally by 2030. The Mingga Mingga Rangers have achieved particular success in co-designing research projects that integrate Western science with traditional knowledge, including reef fish monitoring programs that draw on collective memories of historical fish populations.

## The elusive 2010 management plan and ongoing planning efforts

While a specific "2010 Country Based Management Plan for Palm Island" could not be located through extensive research, this absence itself tells an important story about Indigenous governance and planning processes. Rather than a single comprehensive plan, Palm Island's cultural heritage management operates through multiple overlapping frameworks including Traditional Use of Marine Resources Agreements (TUMRAs), the Palm Island Health Action Plan 2018-2028, and various collaborative arrangements with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority.

The apparent absence of a standalone 2010 heritage plan may reflect the integrated nature of cultural management on Palm Island, where heritage considerations are woven throughout various planning documents rather than segregated into separate plans. It also highlights the challenges of accessing community-specific planning documents that may exist primarily in hard copy within council offices rather than digitized online repositories.

## Current leadership driving economic and cultural renaissance

Today's Palm Island leadership structure spans tourism, education, marine management, and economic development. **Councillor Telstan Sibley leads the tourism and economic development portfolio**, recently securing $4.9 million for a Tourism Masterplan featuring 70 kilometers of walking trails designed to showcase both Manbarra and Bwgcolman cultural heritage. These trails will offer cultural immersion experiences including Indigenous food and medicine programs, guided eco-cultural tours, and Great Barrier Reef experiences.

In marine management, the partnership between Mingga Mingga Rangers and research institutions represents cutting-edge collaborative conservation. Rangers participate in Certificate III and IV training programs, gaining qualifications in marine habitat conservation and government investigations for regulatory compliance. This professionalization of traditional knowledge creates meaningful career pathways while ensuring cultural practices inform contemporary management.

Economic development initiatives extend beyond tourism to include giant clam aquaculture projects led by the Djulin Marine Aboriginal Corporation, whose board includes Wulgurukaba Elder Brian Johnson. These enterprises demonstrate how traditional marine knowledge can support sustainable economic opportunities for future generations.

## Challenges and future directions

Despite significant progress, Palm Island faces substantial challenges. A severe housing shortage requires 120+ new homes, while the council grappled with a $7 million operational deficit in 2020. Infrastructure limitations, including restricted air and sea services, constrain economic development. Most complex is the legal status of Traditional Ownership - while the Manbarra are recognized as original Traditional Owners, the Bwgcolman community's legal rights reflect the reality of over a century of forced co-residence.

Yet the trajectory points toward continued cultural resurgence and self-determination. The success of the Mingga Mingga Rangers demonstrates how Traditional Owner-led management can achieve superior conservation outcomes while creating employment and preserving culture. The transition of the Palm Island Community Company to full community control marks another milestone in the journey from mission control to self-governance.

## Conclusion: From resistance to resurgence

The Manbarra people and Palm Island community have traveled an extraordinary path from pre-contact sovereignty through colonial oppression to contemporary cultural and economic resurgence. From Dick Palm Island's linguistic innovation creating Bwgcolman unity to the Magnificent Seven's courage sparking nationwide wage justice, from the tragic conflicts of the mission era to today's sophisticated ranger programs and tourism initiatives, this history demonstrates the unbreakable strength of Indigenous culture.

Current leaders like Mayor Alf Lacey, ranger coordinator Richard Cassady, and knowledge keeper Regina James stand on the shoulders of generations of resistors and culture keepers. Their work managing sea country, preserving languages, developing sustainable tourism, and building economic independence continues the long struggle for justice and self-determination. As Palm Island develops its Tourism Masterplan and expands ranger programs, it offers a model for how Indigenous communities can honor complex multicultural histories while asserting traditional authority and building prosperous futures.

The story of the Manbarra people and Palm Island ultimately speaks to the power of cultural continuity in the face of systematic attempts at destruction. It reminds us that country, culture, and community endure - transformed but unbroken, adapting ancient wisdom to contemporary challenges while maintaining the sacred connection to the Rainbow Serpent's fragments that form their island home.
