Palm Island's Journey: Leadership, Governance, and Cultural Resilience
Palm Island Community Company (PICC) has evolved from a government-initiated entity to a fully community-controlled organization driving positive change on Great Palm Island. This transformation mirrors the island's broader journey from a place of colonial control to one of Indigenous self-determination. The organization's leadership, particularly CEO Rachel Atkinson, has been instrumental in creating economic opportunities, delivering essential services, and fostering community empowerment against the backdrop of the island's complex colonial history.

Rachel Atkinson: A Visionary Leader for Community Control
Rachel Atkinson, a proud Yorta Yorta woman with deep connections to her Aboriginal heritage, has served as PICC's CEO since its inception in 2007, transforming it from a single-employee operation to the island's largest non-government employer with approximately 180 staff. Her leadership philosophy stems from her family lineage of tireless activists, including her great uncle William Cooper and Sir Douglas Nicholls, who was appointed the first Indigenous Governor of South Australia.

Rachel's professional journey began after completing her Bachelor of Social Work in the early 1980s. Before her education, she worked various jobs including at a prawn factory and cleaning houses. Her leadership experience spans over 25 years as CEO of large Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organizations, including nearly a decade (1996-2006) leading the Townsville Aboriginal and Islander Health Service (TAIHS).

Her greatest achievement came on September 30, 2021, when after years of persistent lobbying, PICC successfully transitioned to full community control, becoming completely owned by community members. This milestone represented a significant advancement toward self-determination for the Palm Island community.

Under Rachel's guidance, PICC has focused on local employment, with approximately 95% of staff being Palm Islanders. This approach has generated around $5.8 million in wages and $9.75 million in economic output for the community. Her integrated service delivery model has also contributed to a significant reduction in the number of Aboriginal children being removed from families on Palm Island.

In addition to her PICC role, Rachel serves in several influential positions including Co-Chair of the Queensland First Children and Families Board, Co-Chair of Family Matters Queensland, Board Director of SNAICC, and Deputy Chairperson of Queensland Aboriginal and Islander Health Council.

PICC's Governance: Community Leadership and Expertise
PICC's board combines local knowledge with professional expertise, creating a governance structure that effectively serves the community's needs while meeting regulatory requirements.

Luella Bligh: Chairperson and Community Leader
As PICC's Chairperson, Luella Bligh played a pivotal role in the organization's transition to community control. When PICC became community-controlled in 2021, she emphasized that the transition was successful because "PICC was already operating with a majority local board and up to 90% local workforce." Under her leadership, PICC continues its strong and professional governance while maintaining essential partnerships with government entities.

Allan Palm Island: Cultural Knowledge and Traditional Ownership
Allan Palm Island holds the significant position of Traditional Owner Director representing the Manbarra people. Born into the cultural traditions of the Palm Island area, he began learning about his culture from his father at age eight, particularly the stories of the Nanggarra Wanggarra people. His formal training includes a Master of Fine Arts from RMIY University Melbourne (1999), and his art depicts the land and sea life, embodying the spiritual connection to his ancestors.

Long-standing Directors and Financial Governance
Rhonda Phillips has been with PICC since its 2007 establishment, bringing over 40 years of experience across community, public, and academic sectors. Her expertise in indigenous governance and service integration has proven invaluable, particularly as she has chaired both the Governance Committee and Finance and Risk Committee.

Matt brings essential financial oversight as a Certified Practicing Accountant–Fellow (FCPA) and Graduate of the Australian Institute of Company Directors. His strategic advice and support complement the community knowledge of other board members.

Community Voice and Professional Expertise
The board includes several members with strong community connections:

Harriet Hulthen, born and raised on Palm Island, brings extensive experience from her work with the Townsville Aboriginal and Islander Legal Service
Raymond, appointed in 2023, is a Bwgcolman man and lifelong Palm Island resident who works as a Teachers Aide at Bwgcolman Community School
Cassie Lang contributes 14 years of legal expertise in Native Title and Indigenous Cultural Heritage matters as Founder & Principal Solicitor at Parallax Legal
This blend of community knowledge, professional expertise, and cultural understanding has enabled PICC to navigate its growth while maintaining strong connections to the community it serves.

PICC's Evolution: From Government Initiative to Community Control
Establishment and Early Growth (2007-2014)
Palm Island Community Company was established in 2007 through a dual shareholder model, with the Queensland Government and Palm Island Aboriginal Shire Council each holding 50% ownership. From the beginning, the organization's purpose was to deliver human and social services, build community capacity, and stimulate economic development on Palm Island.

Rachel Atkinson was appointed as the first CEO, becoming PICC's first and only employee at that time. From this modest beginning, PICC embarked on a steady growth phase, expanding services and workforce while establishing trust within the community and developing governance structures.

Service Expansion and Integration (2014-2021)
By the mid-2010s, PICC had grown significantly, employing approximately 100 staff with 95% being local Palm Islanders. The organization conducted an impact evaluation during this period to assess its achievements and identify areas for future development. A key finding was the importance of transitioning to full community control, leading the Board to begin working on this transition "for more than a year" before 2020.

In August 2021, PICC took a major step forward by assuming responsibility for Palm Island primary health services. This involved amalgamating their existing health center with the Townsville Hospital and Health Service primary health center to create an integrated community-controlled Aboriginal Medical Service.

Achievement of Community Control (2021)
The transition to full community control represented the fulfillment of PICC's long-term vision. On September 30, 2021, after years of lobbying by CEO Rachel Atkinson and the PICC Board, all services, workforce, and assets were transferred to a new company that maintained the Palm Island Community Company name but was now fully owned by Palm Islanders.

Palm Island Mayor and past chairperson of PICC, Mislam Sam, described this as "a hard-won achievement for the Palm Island community," noting that the community, its elders, and leaders had "worked for decades for self-determination."

Current Services and Impact
Today, PICC delivers a comprehensive range of services designed to address the specific needs of the Palm Island community:

Health Services: Primary Health Care Centre providing integrated medical services, health promotion initiatives, and social and emotional wellbeing services
Child and Family Services: Family Wellbeing Centre, Safe House, Family Participation Program, and youth engagement initiatives
Community Support: Women's Service providing temporary accommodation for women and children experiencing domestic violence, Men's Gathering supporting mental health, and the Elders Advisory Group providing cultural guidance
Social Enterprises: Bakery, fuel station, mechanics workshop, and the Digital Service Centre opened in June 2023
PICC has had a transformative impact on the Palm Island community, creating over 100 jobs for local Palm Islanders, improving access to essential services, strengthening community capacity through leadership development, and enhancing cultural connection through programs guided by community elders.

Great Palm Island: From Colonial Control to Self-Determination
Indigenous Heritage and Traditional Ownership
The original inhabitants of Great Palm Island are the Manbarra people, also known as the Wulgurukaba people, whose traditional territory included the Palm Island group and mainland areas around Townsville. In Manbarra beliefs, the Palm Island group was formed in the Dreamtime when fragments of the Rainbow Serpent broke apart.

The Manbarra spoke two dialects on the island: Buluguyban and Mulgu, which belonged to the Nyawaygic language family. It's estimated that around 200 Manbarra people inhabited the island at the time of European contact in 1770, though most were forcibly removed to the mainland by the 1890s.

Colonial History and the Aboriginal Reserve
Captain James Cook named the "Palm Isles" in 1770 during his exploration of Australia's east coast. Palm Island was officially gazetted as an Aboriginal reserve on June 20, 1914, though few Aboriginal people lived there initially.

The settlement was properly established in 1918 when residents from the Hull River Aboriginal Settlement, which had been destroyed by a cyclone, were relocated to Palm Island. From this point, Palm Island became a place where Aboriginal people from throughout Queensland were forcibly relocated, often as punishment for "infractions" against the restrictive policies of the Protection Era.

Queensland's Chief Protector J.W. Bleakley specifically designated Palm Island as "a penitentiary for troublesome cases." Over the first two decades, the population grew from 200 to 1,630 individuals, representing at least 57 different language groups from across Queensland and the Torres Strait Islands. This diverse group of displaced people would later become known collectively as the Bwgcolman people ("many tribes – one people").

Strike 57: A Turning Point in Resistance
The 1957 strike marked a watershed moment in Palm Island's history. By the 1950s, conditions were extremely harsh, with residents required to work 30 hours weekly, often receiving no wages or just tobacco as payment. Housing was poor, rations were inadequate, and strict controls were imposed on all aspects of life.

The strike began when Superintendent Roy Bartlam threatened to deport Albie Geia, who had allegedly disobeyed a European overseer. Geia and six other men (Willie Thaiday, Eric Lymburner, Sonny Sibley, Bill Congoo, George Watson, and Gordon Tapau) organized a community-wide strike that began on June 10, 1957.

After five days, armed police arrived from Townsville and conducted dawn raids on the homes of strike leaders. The "Magnificent Seven," as they became known, were arrested at gunpoint with their families and forcibly removed from Palm Island. They were shipped to the mainland in chains and exiled to different Aboriginal settlements across Queensland.

This remarkable act of courage has become a proud moment in the ongoing movement for Indigenous rights and justice, commemorated annually on June 9.

Path to Self-Governance
Until the early 1970s, Palm Island residents lived under strict control, with morning roll calls, nightly curfews, and a bell tower (which still stands today) signaling daily routines. Significant changes began in the 1970s:

1975: The children's dormitories, operating since 1922, were officially closed
1984: The last vestiges of the Protection Act were abolished
1985: Queensland Government relinquished control and passed title to the Palm Island Community Council via a Deed of Grant in Trust (DOGIT)
March 30, 1985: Palm Island Aboriginal Council established with five elected councillors
January 1, 2005: The Council became the Palm Island Aboriginal Shire Council, gaining the same legal status as other local councils in Queensland
Contemporary Palm Island
According to the 2021 census, Palm Island's population is 2,138 people, with 89.7% identifying as Indigenous Australians. The community is younger than the Australian average, with 32.0% under age 15 and only 3.3% over age 64.

The island faces significant socioeconomic challenges, with a high unemployment rate (29.1%) and a median weekly personal income of A$306, less than half of Queensland's median. However, recent developments like the new retail center, digital service center, and community-controlled health services represent steps toward self-determination.

Today, Palm Island is governed by the Palm Island Aboriginal Shire Council, which operates under a Deed of Grant in Trust. The cultural significance of the island is multifaceted—for the Manbarra people, it has deep spiritual significance as part of their Dreamtime story; for the Bwgcolman people, it represents both a place of historical trauma and a symbol of resilience and survival.

Conclusion
The story of Palm Island and PICC exemplifies the journey from colonial control to Indigenous self-determination. Through the leadership of figures like Rachel Atkinson and the PICC Board, Palm Island has made significant strides in economic development, service delivery, and community governance. Despite facing ongoing challenges stemming from historical injustices, the community demonstrates remarkable resilience and determination in building a future grounded in cultural strength and self-governance. The 2021 transition of PICC to full community control represents a significant milestone in this ongoing journey, creating opportunities for sustainable development led by and for the Palm Island community.
