#### Core Principles:
- **Community Ownership**: All content is owned and controlled by the Palm Island community
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Proper protocols for sharing stories, especially elder knowledge
- **Permission-Based Access**: Different levels of access based on community roles and relationships
- **Attribution & Respect**: Proper acknowledgment of storytellers and knowledge holders
