## 🔥 Cultural Protocols - Keep It Safe & Respectful

### Before Sharing Any Story:
1. **Do I have permission?** ✅ Make sure everyone mentioned is okay with sharing
2. **Is this appropriate to share?** ✅ Check if it's private/sacred/sensitive  
3. **Who should be credited?** ✅ Give proper credit to storytellers/photographers
4. **What sharing level?** ✅ Public, Community-Only, or Restricted access

### For Elder Stories - Extra Care:
- **Always** get explicit permission from the elder or their family
- **Never** assume traditional knowledge can be shared publicly
- **Always** have a cultural advisor review the story first
- **Remember** that some stories are for certain people/times/places only

### Red Flags - When NOT to Share:
❌ Sacred or ceremonial information  
❌ Private family matters  
❌ Stories told in confidence  
❌ Anything that could harm someone  
❌ Photos from funerals or sorry business  

**When in doubt, ask a cultural advisor!**
