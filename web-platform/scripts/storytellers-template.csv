"Uncle Frank - Storm Recovery Story","When the cyclone hit in 2019, I was worried about the old people in our community. But I saw something amazing - the young ones stepped up right away. They checked on the Elders first, made sure everyone had food and water. That's how we do things here on Palm Island. The storm took our houses but it showed our strength."
"Auntie Mary - Growing Up on Palm Island","I've lived here all my life, and I've seen a lot of changes. Some good, some hard. But what never changes is our connection to this place and to each other. My grandmother taught me about the land, and I'm teaching my grandchildren the same lessons."
"Community Elder - Traditional Knowledge","We need to pass on our knowledge to the next generation. Not just the stories, but the practical knowledge - how to read the weather, which plants are medicine, how to care for Country. This knowledge kept our people alive for thousands of years."
